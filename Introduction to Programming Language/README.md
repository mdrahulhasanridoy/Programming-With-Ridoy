# Introduction to Programming Language

We will be start our programming journey with C programming language.

- In 1972, Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs developed C programming language. 

### What is header file?
A header file is like a calculator through which we can calculate anything. In C programming language, we can use header file to use any function.

<details>
<summary>First C Program</summary>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```
</details>

stdio.h -> standard input output header file
std -> standard
io -> input output

<details>
<summary> Two types of function in C programming language </summary>

```
1. User defined function
2. Library function
```

| main function | printf function |
| --- | --- |
| User defined function | Library function/ built in function |

</details>

In C programming language, we can use printf function to print anything on the screen.

```c
    printf("Hello World");
```
