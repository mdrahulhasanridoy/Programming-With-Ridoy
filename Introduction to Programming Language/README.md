# Introduction to Programming Language

We will be start our programming journey with C programming language.

- In 1972, Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs developed C programming language. 

### What is header file?
A header file is like a calculator through which we can calculate anything. In C programming language, we can use header file to use any function.

### First C Program

First C program is to print "Hello World" on the screen.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```

stdio.h -> standard input output header file
std -> standard
io -> input output
